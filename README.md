# Tabulator

Tabulator was created in the class CS448b - Data Visualization at Stanford Spring 2016. 

Tabulator is a web app to quickly create and download a well-designed table for use in papers and similar. The table generated upholds known principles in visualization and perception and is very easy to use. All the user needs is a data file containing the data they want to tabulate. After creation, some optional customization of the table is possible to allow users to specialize the table for their needs.
